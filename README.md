### Overview
Our Town Library sought to modernize its systems while maintaining the high level of service patrons have come to expect. 
The goal of the E-Library project was to digitize core operations and resources into an easy to use web application for both staff and clients. 
The backend focuses on centralizing the management of books, users and transactions.

### Features
Library Administration
  * Administrators can efficiently manage the library's collection through the API. It provides functionality to add and update book metadata in bulk. 
  * User accounts and permissions can also be centrally managed. Borrowing histories, return checking, reservation confirmation and overdue notifications 
streamline typical daily tasks.

### Patron Access
Registered patrons benefit from convenient digital access to library resources anytime, anywhere. Features like making reservations, checking current 
loans and upcoming availability allow our patrons to continue utilizing the library remotely. Online borrowing also reduces physical contact amidst 
public health concerns.

### Technical Implementation
Our Town Library selected a robust and scalable technical stack to power the E-Library backend services:

### Data Persistence
A PostgreSQL database securely stores critical book, user and transaction data. Its reliability and features ensure the library's digital assets 
and patron privacy are well protected.

### Performance
Frequently accessed metadata and queries are cached using Caffeine to optimize response times for a better user experience.

### Adaptability
Liquibase automates database changes and initial book catalog loading, avoiding disruptions from migrations over time.

### Automation
Time-based cleanup of expired reservations runs through scheduled cron jobs, maintaining data integrity without manual oversight.

### Documentation
Swagger integration generates interactive API documentation for easy third-party integrations like a mobile app.

By leveraging these technologies, Our Town Library gained a future-proof digital foundation to continue its mission of serving the community for years to come.
